# TRACE

> Track clarity. Reflect growth. Compound legacy.

A minimal habit tracker for builders who want to see their progress, not their dopamine hits.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Track multiple habits (Meditation, Gym, Reading etc.)
- Log how many reps/hours done per day
- Visualize progress with minimal charts
- Track streaks and consistency
- Store your data locally — no accounts, no tracking

## ✨ Why I Built This

Most habit apps are either:

- Too basic (just checkboxes)
- Or too gamified (dopamine-driven, not data-driven)

I wanted something that felt like a **tool for builders**, not a toy.

TRACE helps me stay consistent with the habits that compound my long-term leverage — learning, thinking, building.

## 🛠 How to Use It

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- Add daily reflection logging
- Support for tags per habit
- More charts: streak calendar, velocity graph
- PWA / mobile experience
- Export / import habits
